# PictoRoom!

### What is PictoRoom?

PictoRoom is a *blatant* copy of Pictochat, a game included by default in the famous Nintendo DS.
It functions as a chat where you communicate via drawings!
Share time with your friends or pals trying to guess eachother's drawings, playing tic-tac-toe or just chatting!

### How can I set it up?
If you wanna set it up for yourself, first create a .env and put this into it: 
```
URL_ENTIRE=http://localhost:8080/
```
Replace the URL_ENTIRE variable with whatever domain you're going to use to access PictoRoom. Make sure to leave a trailing slash("/") at the end!
