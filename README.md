# PictoRoom!

### What is PictoRoom?

PictoRoom is a *blatant* copy of Pictochat, a game included by default in the famous Nintendo DS.
It functions as a chat where you communicate via drawings!
Share time with your friends or pals trying to guess eachother's drawings, playing tic-tac-toe or just chatting!
